            <h4>How I started Web Development</h4>
            <p>In my free time, I'd like to go fishing, hunting, and camping. I was born in Saint Paul, Minnsota, and lived there my whole life. My recent postition was a Sales Consultant at AutoNation Ford White Bear lake. I've been working as a Sales Consultant for over 4 months, and in sales for almost my whole work career. In the end of Feburary, I decided to make a career change. This lead me to take a persue The University of Minnesota Continuing Education to learn Full-Stack Web Development. </p>
